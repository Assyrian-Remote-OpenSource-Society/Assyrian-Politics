# Assyrian-Politics
This repository contains modern Assyrian politics data. It is not a complete list by any means.

## Scope
At this time, the type of data contained includes:

- Names of Assyrian politicians of Iraq
- Names of political parties in which the listed Assyrian politicians are involved (may include non-Assyrian parties)
- Names of lists

These are not up-to-date lists. Some listed politicians may no longer be involved in politics. As such, some lists and parties may have been temporary and no longer in effect.

## Format
Currently, there is no data format; however, one should be planned and implemented. Initiating the effort had higher priority than formatting the data.

## Analysis
This repository may include political and/or data analysis.

## Contribution
Please feel free to contribute in any way. Thank you.
